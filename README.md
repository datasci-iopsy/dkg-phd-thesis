## Overview

The objective of this study is to investigate, parse, quantify, and compare the within- and between-person variability of burnout and basic psychological need frustrations when predicting turnover intentions over the course of a workday. Given the longitudinal nature of this study, a repeated measures design is utilized and analyzed using a mixed-effects paradigm for enhanced statistically flexibility.

## Conceptual Framework & Variables

Participants will be measured across three timepoints within a single workday. There will be specific *timepoint-stems* used to distinguish the intervals (e.g., "Since starting work today" or "Since the last survey check-in"). The items within each variable-block was randomized to reduce response bias (**citation TBD**).

Basic Psychological Needs Thwarting Scale (*PNTS; Bartholomew et al., 2011a*)

2. There are times when I am told things that make me feel incompetent
3. There are situations where I am made to feel inadequate
4. I feel inadequate because I am not given opportunities to fulfil my potential

**Autonomy Thwarting**

1. I feel prevented from making choices regarding the way I train
2. I feel pushed to behave in certain ways
3. I feel obliged to follow training decisions made for me
4. I feel under pressure to agree with the training regimen I am provided

**Relatedness Thwarting**

1. I feel I am rejected by those around me
2. I feel others can be dismissive of me
3. I feel other people dislike me
4. I feel some of the coworkers around me are envious when I achieve success

### Moderating Variables

Psychological Contract (*Robinson & Morrison, 2000*)

*{Timepoint-stem}*, indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with the following statements about your experiences so far.

**Perceived Contract Breach**

1. Almost none of the promises made by my employer have been kept so far.
2. I feel that my employer has failed to fulfill the promises made to me when I was hired.
3. So far, my employer has done a poor job of fulfilling its promises to me.
4. I have not received everything my employer promised to me in exchange for my contributions.
5. My employer has broken many of its promises to me, even though I have upheld my side of the deal.

**Violation**

1. I feel a significant amount of anger toward my organization.
2. I feel deeply betrayed by my organization.
3. I feel that my organization has seriously violated the contract between us.
4. I feel extremely frustrated with how I have been treated by my organization.

## Limitations

Primarily, vague response anchors were used to assess frequency. While Tong et al. (2020) demonstrated that precise response options yield superior performance, the expedited timeline of this study necessitated the use of less specific anchors. In future research, particularly longitudinal studies spanning months or years or cross-sectional designs, employing more precise response options would likely enhance measurement reliability and validity.

Although statistical analyses were conducted to assess the extent of same-source bias or common method bias, these methods cannot entirely eliminate its potential influence on the findings (See *Williams, Hartman, & Cavazotte, 2010**).

The sample is likely WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) and limited to participants working standard 9-to-5 shifts. It is plausible that differences may emerge across non-standard shifts, warranting further investigation to explore potential variations (See *Alley & Cortina, 2023*).

Latent mean centering is recognized as a superior technique for disentangling fixed and random effects. However, implementing this approach in R presented significant challenges. A Bayesian framework may offer a more robust alternative by modeling means as distributions, thereby directly accounting for uncertainty in the estimates (see *Hamaker & Muthén, 2020*).

Need satisfaction and need frustration are known to predict positive and negative outcomes differentially. This study focuses specifically on need thwarting or frustration, thereby capturing only one aspect of the broader dynamic. Future research should aim to provide a more balanced perspective by examining both need satisfaction and frustration.
