By: Demetrius K. Green

A dissertation submitted to the Graduate Faculty of North Carolina State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

Industrial-Organizational Psychology

Raleigh, North Carolina (2025)

## Overview

The objective of this study is to investigate, parse, quantify, and compare the within- and between-person variability of burnout and basic psychological need frustrations when predicting turnover intentions over the course of a workday. Given the longitudinal nature of this study, a repeated measures design is utilized and analyzed using a mixed-effects paradigm for enhanced statistically flexibility.

## Conceptual Framework & Measurement Model

Participants will be measured across three timepoints within a single respective workday. There will be specific item-stems that corresponds to a particular timepoint: (1) Since starting work today, (2) Since the first survey check-in, and (3) Since the last survey check-in. Items within each variable-block will be randomized to reduce order bias.

## Process Model

![thesis-process-model](figs/thesis-process-model.svg)

## Analytical Strategy

### Descriptive Statistics
- Means, standard deviations, and ranges for all variables
- Frequencies for categorical variables
- Correlations between variables and visualizations of relationships
  - Pearson's *r* for continuous variables aggregated up to L2 level
  - `rmcorr` for continuous variables at the L1 level
- Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) to assess within- and between-person variability
- Visualizations of data distributions (e.g., histograms, boxplots, etc.)
- Careless responding analysis (*Meade & Craig, 2012*)
- Missing data analysis (moot since only complete responses will be used)
- Outlier detection and handling (e.g., z-scores, boxplots/violent plots, etc.)
- Normality checks (e.g., skewness and kurtosis, Shapiro-Wilk test, etc.)
- Test for group differences (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) if applicable (e.g., remote flag)
- Effect size calculations (e.g., Cohen's d, eta-squared) for group differences
- Visualizations of group differences (e.g., bar plots, violin plots, etc.)

### Reliability
- Composite index (McDonald’s omega, see *Geldhof et al., 2014; Fu, Wen, & Wang, 2022; Yang et al., 2022* for theoretical justification)

### Correlation
- Between-persons
- Within-persons

### Common Method Variance & Factor Structure
- CFA Marker Technique (see *Williams, Hartman, & Cavazotte, 2010*)
- Multilevel CFA

### Sensitivity Analysis of Power

The author developed an [R program](/srcR/run_power_analysis) to run robust sensitivity analyses of power based on the work of *Arend & Schäfer, 2019*. The program leverages the `furrr` (for parallelization) and `simr` packages in R. The original work of *Arend & Schäfer, 2019* was essentially expanded to focus on a (customizable) matrix comprising the following parameters:

Parameter Variations:
- Level 1 sample size (3)
- Level 2 sample sizes (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000)
- Level 1 direct effect size (0.10, 0.30, 0.50)
- Level 2 direct effect size (0.10, 0.30, 0.50)
- Cross-level effect size (0.10, 0.30, 0.50)
- ICC values (0.10, 0.30, 0.50)
- Random slope variance values (0.01, 0.09, 0.25)
- Significance level (0.05)

There are a few more configurable values included in the program, but the current study's setup created a 5 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = **1,215 parameter matrix** where each cell represented a unique combination of parameters. The simulations were run for 1,000 iterations per cell, resulting in a total of **1,215,000 simulations**. To review the code and get a detailed breakdown along with instructions on how to run the process, see the program's [README](srcR/run_power_analysis/README.md).

Each power analysis calculated detection probability for three effects:
- L1 Direct Effect
- L2 Direct Effect
- Cross-Level Interaction

By systematically varying key assumptions (ICC, effect sizes, random slope variance, etc.) and running simulations, the program provided insights into the sensitivity of power estimates under different conditions.

~~The results were visualized using `ggplot2` to illustrate how power varies with sample size, effect size, ICC, and random slope variance.~~

The process took over 72 hours to complete on a local machine using `Total Number of Cores - 2` with the following specs:

```

This overhead could (and most likely will) be reduced by leveraging Google Cloud platform's (GCP) compute engine API to run the simulations in parallel on a larger scale. For example, a virtual machine (VM) instance with the following specs could theoretically run the simulations in 3 to 6 hours (i.e., 8-16x performance improvement...but at a cost :money_with_wings:):

- Compute-Optimized C2D (Best Price-Performance)
    - Machine Type: `c2d-highcpu-56` or `c2d-highcpu-112`
    - 56-112 vCPUs, 4-8 GB RAM per vCPU

## Limitations

Primarily, vague response anchors were used to assess frequency. While Tong et al. (2020) demonstrated that precise response options yield superior performance, the expedited timeline of this study necessitated the use of less specific anchors. In future research, particularly longitudinal studies spanning months or years or cross-sectional designs, employing more precise response options would likely enhance measurement reliability and validity.

Although statistical analyses were conducted to assess the extent of same-source bias or common method bias, these methods cannot entirely eliminate its potential influence on the findings (See *Williams, Hartman, & Cavazotte, 2010**).

The sample is likely WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) and limited to participants working standard 9-to-5 shifts. It is plausible that differences may emerge across non-standard shifts, warranting further investigation to explore potential variations (See *Alley & Cortina, 2023*).

Latent mean centering is recognized as a superior technique for disentangling fixed and random effects. However, implementing this approach in R presented significant challenges. A Bayesian framework may offer a more robust alternative by modeling means as distributions, thereby directly accounting for uncertainty in the estimates (see *Hamaker & Muthén, 2020*).
In addition, sampling error in the group means exists because the literal group means were used as the L2 estimates. As with the previous point, there are ways to address this (empirical Bayes) but none are easily implemented with the R software..hence the limitation. See this [article](https://centerstat.org/biased-between-group-effects/) by Curran and Bauer. Additionally, check out this link which explains why one should check for random slopes in the predictors as well [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/can-you-provide-a-comprehensiv-zuN14_igRg2ZVKnuFg.vCg#1)

Need satisfaction and need frustration are known to predict positive and negative outcomes differentially. This study focuses specifically on need thwarting or frustration, thereby capturing only one aspect of the broader dynamic. Future research should aim to provide a more balanced perspective by examining both need satisfaction and frustration.

Perhaps there is a curvilinear (i.e., quadratic) trend in turnover intentions across the measurement occasions for which the present study did not account.

The sample size is too small to test the moderating relationships in a single model; in fact, some of the global constructs might have to be used due to power issues. Separate models will most likely have to be tested to get an understanding of the phenomena.
