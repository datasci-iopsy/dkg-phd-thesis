## Overview

The objective of this study is to investigate, parse, quantify, and compare the within- and between-person variability of burnout and basic psychological need frustrations when predicting turnover intentions over the course of a workday. Given the longitudinal nature of this study, a repeated measures design is utilized and analyzed using a mixed-effects paradigm for enhanced statistically flexibility.

## Conceptual Framework & Measurement Model

Participants will be measured across three timepoints within a single workday. There will be specific item-stems that corresponds to a particular timepoint: (1) Since starting work today, (2) Since the first survey check-in, and (3) Since the last survey check-in. Items within each variable-block will be randomized to reduce order bias.

## Limitations

Primarily, vague response anchors were used to assess frequency. While Tong et al. (2020) demonstrated that precise response options yield superior performance, the expedited timeline of this study necessitated the use of less specific anchors. In future research, particularly longitudinal studies spanning months or years or cross-sectional designs, employing more precise response options would likely enhance measurement reliability and validity.

Although statistical analyses were conducted to assess the extent of same-source bias or common method bias, these methods cannot entirely eliminate its potential influence on the findings (See *Williams, Hartman, & Cavazotte, 2010**).

The sample is likely WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) and limited to participants working standard 9-to-5 shifts. It is plausible that differences may emerge across non-standard shifts, warranting further investigation to explore potential variations (See *Alley & Cortina, 2023*).

Latent mean centering is recognized as a superior technique for disentangling fixed and random effects. However, implementing this approach in R presented significant challenges. A Bayesian framework may offer a more robust alternative by modeling means as distributions, thereby directly accounting for uncertainty in the estimates (see *Hamaker & Muthén, 2020*).

Need satisfaction and need frustration are known to predict positive and negative outcomes differentially. This study focuses specifically on need thwarting or frustration, thereby capturing only one aspect of the broader dynamic. Future research should aim to provide a more balanced perspective by examining both need satisfaction and frustration.
