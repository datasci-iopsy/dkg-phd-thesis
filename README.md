## Overview

The objective of this study is to investigate, parse, quantify, and compare the within- and between-person variability of burnout and basic psychological need frustrations when predicting turnover intentions over the course of a workday. Given the longitudinal nature of this study, a repeated measures design is utilized and analyzed using a mixed-effects paradigm for enhanced statistically flexibility.

## Conceptual Framework & Variables

Participants will be measured across three timepoints within a single workday contingent upon their shift (e.g., 1st shift: 09:00 to 17:00, 2nd shift: 16:00 to 00:00, 3rd shift: 23:00 to 07:00). The dependent, independent, moderating, and marker variables are time invariant; that is, they will be measured across the three timepoints. The attention check items will also be included across the three timepoints. The control variables (demographics inclusive), however, will only be measured once at timepoint “0.” 

### Dependent Variables

Turnover Intentions (*Spector et al., 1988*)

Response Anchors: Frequency-based
- Never
- Rather infrequently
- Some of the time
- Quite often
- Always

Turnover Intention (see *Matthews et al., 2022* for theoretical justification of single item measures)

1. How often have you seriously considered leaving your current job so far today?

### Independent Variables

Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM; *Shirom & Melamed, 2006*)

Response Anchors: Frequency-based (vague vs. precise; see *Tong et al., 2020*)
- Never
- Once 
- A few times
- Several times 
- Very frequently

Subscales

**Physical Fatigue**

1. I feel tired
2. I am lacking energy for my work
3. I feel physically drained
4. I feel fed-up
5. I feel like my “batteries” are “dead”
6. I feel burned out

**Cognitive Weariness**

1. My thinking process is slow
2. I have difficulty concentrating
3. I feel I am not thinking clearly
4. I feel I am not focused on my thinking
5. I have difficulty thinking about complex things

**Emotional Exhaustion**

1. I feel I am unable to be sensitive to the needs of coworkers or customers
2. I feel I am not capable of investing emotionally in coworkers or customers
3. I feel I am not capable of being sympathetic to coworkers or customers

Basic Psychological Needs Thwarting Scale (PNTS; *Bartholomew et al., 2011a*)

Response Anchors: Agreement-based
- Strongly disagree
- Disagree
- Neither agree nor disagree
- Agree
- Strongly agree

Subscales

Competency Thwarting

1. There are occasions where I feel incompetent because others impose unrealistic expectations upon me
2. There are times when I am told things that make me feel incompetent
3. There are situations where I am made to feel inadequate
4. I feel inadequate because I am not given opportunities to fulfil my potential

Autonomy Thwarting

1. I feel prevented from making choices regarding the way I train
2. I feel pushed to behave in certain ways
3. I feel obliged to follow training decisions made for me
4. I feel under pressure to agree with the training regimen I am provided

Relatedness Thwarting	
1. I feel I am rejected by those around me
2. I feel others can be dismissive of me
3. I feel other people dislike me
4. I feel some of the coworkers around me are envious when I achieve success

### Moderating Variables

1. How many meetings have you attended?
   - Response Anchors: Count-based 
     - 0 to *n*

Time in Work Meetings

1. How much time (in hours) have you spent in meetings? *Note*: use divisible increments (15 mins = .25 hours, 30 mins = .50 hours, 60 mins = 1 hour, etc.). 
    - Response Anchors: Continuous
      - 0 to *n*

### Marker Variables

Attitude Toward the Color Blue (ATCB; *Miller et al., 2024; Miller & Simmering, 2023*)

Response Anchors: Agreement-based

- Somewhat agree
- Neither agree nor disagree
- Somewhat disagree
- Strongly agree

Subscale
