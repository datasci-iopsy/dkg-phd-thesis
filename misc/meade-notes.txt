- Set up a regular schedule (Summer is a little different)
- Adam's been doing a 30 minute check-in (whatever works better for me)
- In general: building something new and not really sufficient; answer some kind of research question - building an SJT makes sense but what question would you answer? 
	- Need some meet outside of just validity and building
	- Methdologically 

A lot of things vary using that approach 
- a lot of stuff 
- What about trajectory vs patterns
- constructs of interest to measure and their relationships
- things around occupational health and well-being

Gathering some research questions (make a list): theoretically or methodological contributions - 
- Search the domain
- Start with a list of things that are of interest
What has been done


Once you have a topic - think about what to do
Adam's start with the methods
Make an outline based on what headers I'll be using 
	- What do people want to know - for job satisfaction - answer the why?!
	- what the research questions are

Plan to write a bad paper - get past that and just write it out:
	- Put something down
	- break it into mini sections

I should focus on saying something and then find

Next steps: 
Think more about the topic (variables of interest) & methodology 
Having a question that is just content focuses vs methodological approaches 
When comparing methods, we need to figure out what has been done, so are we figuring out which is best
- needs to be a takeaway from someone; taking and collecting; what kind of questions are one trying to answer

The easier of the two - answer a substiative question using a novel method - using a method you like that.

The road map and idea will be the difficult thing to knock out. Goal: Set up a system that will be helpful for me. 
- One system is on my own
- Setting up regular meetings for accountability

Perfect is the enemy of good. Don't worry about the logistics. Start with the idea I want to test, thesis. We've had better luck with Prolific recently! 
- Adam ideas: daily diary; 
- Best bet is to pull people from outside of the committee;


Someone that has the literature and theory can enter the realm:
