# Pub/Sub -- Intake Response Processing
# ================================================================
# Topic for asynchronous processing of completed intake surveys.
# After writing a response to BigQuery, the qualtrics scheduling
# function publishes a message to this topic. The intake
# confirmation function subscribes via Eventarc (the subscription
# is created automatically when the function is deployed with a
# Pub/Sub trigger via manage_functions.py).
#
# Managed by manage_pubsub.py. Run 'setup' to create the topic;
# 'teardown' to delete it.
